Hibernate Module
================

* This module enables Helma NG to use Hibernate as its ORM/persistence layer.
* For a reference implementation have a look at hibernate-blog dir in the Helma NG apps dir.
* Especially the contents of its config, app/mappings, app/models and app/controllers dirs should be of interest.
